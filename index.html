                Hi! My name is Amirhasan, but to make things easier for others, I go by Amir. I have masters degree in Mechanical Enginnering
                and have been working as a Manufactruing Engineer for the last 5 years. In my mind, however, I would like
                to think about myself as an Engineer. To me, Engineers are individuals who solve problems as tehy are presented
                to them. Regardless of the complexity or subject, an Engineer always welcome challenges and tries to explore
                options to solve them. When facing a challenge, an Engineer would ask: "how can I solve this?" in lieu of
                looking for reasons why it can't be done.
